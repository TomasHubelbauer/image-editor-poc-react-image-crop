# Image editor proof of concept with `react-image-crop`

This repository is based on https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/bun-react.
It contains a PoC of https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/image-editor-poc built
with the `react-image-crop` library.

NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-crop
GitHub: https://github.com/sekoyo/react-image-crop

## To-Do

### Figure out how to fix the `canvas` with checkerboard pattern misplacement

It appears behind everything for some reason.
When I pull out the `ReactCrop` from the `dialog` it is still broken.
